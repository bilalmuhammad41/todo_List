This app is live at: [My Todos](https://bilalmuhammad41.github.io/theme_switcher/)

## Overview

This is a basic Todo List I built to gain a better understanding of React's Context API and to create a practical application for a todo list where user can create, read, update, and delete todos.

### Features

- Add, edit, and remove tasks on your to-do list.
- Data is stored locally using browser Local Storage.
- Clean and responsive user interface designed with Tailwind CSS.
- Utilizes the Context API for state management in React.

### Technologies Used

- **React:** I used React to build the core functionality of the theme switcher, taking advantage of React's powerful state management capabilities.

- **Vite:** I initialized the project using Vite, a build tool for web development. It allowed me to quickly set up the project and streamline the development process.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS was used for styling the project, making it responsive and visually appealing.

### Acknowledgement

- I followed the React context API with local storage crash course by [Chai or Code](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode) on YouTube.
